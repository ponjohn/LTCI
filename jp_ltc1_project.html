a. Description of the webpage project for John Pon, jp_ltc1_project.html
Design & Development objective was to convert customer's webpage developed by Dreamweaver HTML4 into Html5.

Started the project by:
* spent time looking at the index.html source code looking for ways to simplify the code so there would be less code to convert.
* reformated the HTML4 source code made it easier to find duplications & inline-styles to simplify & convert.
* finally the html5 code was simplified to remove duplications and a CSS file was created to remove the inline-styles from the index.html page.

Project deliverables will be:
a. Description of the webpage
b. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) code
c. CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) code
d. Browser output generated by the HTML & CSS code

Went to a meetup at Type A Machines (3D printing):
* learned that the founders of the company met at a meetup.
* learned from one of the founders, what really matters is what you can do, not the degrees you have.
